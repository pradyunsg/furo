# Quickstart

furo is available on [PyPI]. It provides a single customizable HTML theme for Sphinx-based documentation sets.

- Install furo in documentation's build environment.

  ```
  pip install furo
  ```

- Update the `html_theme` in `conf.py`.

  ```py
  html_theme = "furo"
  ```

- Your Sphinx documentation's HTML pages will now be generated with this theme! 🎉

```{note}
If you don't have a Sphinx documentation set to use this theme on, look at [Sphinx's Getting Started] for instructions on how to create one.
