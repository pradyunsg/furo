# Lists

```{furo-demo}
- Lists in Markdown are pretty straightforward.
- A bunch of bullet points.
  - Nested bullets should be indented by two or more spaces.
  - They can just "show up" inline with the rest of the list.


1. Numbered lists are not complicated.
2. They do exactly what you think they do.

- A bunch of bullet points.

  - Nested bullets should be indented by **exactly** two spaces.
  - They also need a blank line before them, otherwise it doesn't work right.
