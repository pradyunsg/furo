# Customisation

TODO: provide information about:

- how the entire theme is designed with CSS variables and how to override them
  - via `css_variables` in conf.py (recommended, if you're not adding more CSS)
  - custom CSS files
- how `basic` theme's variables can be set but won't do s\*\*\*
- and finally, go read references for specific elements!
