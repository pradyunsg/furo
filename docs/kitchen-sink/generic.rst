=============
Generic items
=============

These are the things that don't quite fit into other groupings.

Inline Markup
=============

One of the nice things about markup languages is the ability to have inline
markup. This makes the presentation *much* nicer. The **bold** text shouldn't
be too overbearing. It is very common to have ``inline code`` as well. It is
important to ensure that the inline code doesn't have a line height that is
greater than the regular prose; otherwise the spacing looks weird.

It is also possible to use explicit roles to do things like a :sub:`subscript`,
a :sup:`superscript`, :emphasis:`emphasis`, :strong:`strong`, and
:literal:`literal`.

Hyperlinks
----------

It is a website, so it'll have hyperlinks like http://www.python.org (inline),
or Python_ (external reference), example_ (internal reference),
`Python web site <http://www.python.org>`__ (external hyperlinks with embedded
URI), footnote references (manually numbered [1]_, anonymous auto-numbered [#]_,
labeled auto-numbered [#label]_, or symbolic [*]_), citation references ([12]_),
substitution references (|example|), and _`inline hyperlink targets`
(see Targets_ below for a reference back to here).

reStructuredText has character-level inline markup too. It's ugly to write, but
someone might be using it, so here's an example: **re**\ ``Structured``\ *Text*.

It is also possible to link to documented items, such as
:class:`api_sample.RandomNumberGenerator`.

Interpreted text
----------------

The default role for "interpreted text" (AKA single backticks) is
`Title Reference`. There are other reference syntaxes as well: :PEP:`287` and
:RFC:`2822`.

If the ``--pep-references`` option was supplied, there should be a live link to
PEP 258 here.

GUI labels
^^^^^^^^^^

According to the RST demo, GUI labels (like :guilabel:`this label`) are a way to
indicate that some action is to be taken by the user. Like inline code literals,
GUI labels should not run over line height.

Keys / Menu labels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Key-bindings indicate that the reader is to press a button on the keyboard or
mouse, for example :kbd:`MMB`, :kbd:`⌘+⇧+M` and :kbd:`Shift-MMB`. Another
useful way is ``menuselection`` to show menus:
:menuselection:`My --> Software --> Some menu --> Some sub menu 1 --> Some sub menu 2 --> Some sub menu 3`

For example, ``menuselection`` should break when it is too long to fit on a
single line.

Long inline code wrapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. DO NOT RE-WRAP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!

Let's test wrapping and whitespace significance in inline literals:
``This is an example of --inline-literal --text, --including some--
strangely--hyphenated-words.  Adjust-the-width-of-your-browser-window
to see how the text is wrapped.  -- ---- --------  Now note    the
spacing    between the    words of    this sentence    (words
should    be grouped    in pairs).``

Math
====

This is a test. Here is an equation:
:math:`X_{0:5} = (X_0, X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4)`.
Here is another:

.. math::
    :label: This is a label

    \nabla^2 f =
    \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}
    \left( r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right) +
    \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}
    \left( \sin \theta \, \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \right) +
    \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2\theta} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2}

You can add a link to equations like the one above :eq:`This is a label` by using
``:eq:``.

Code with Sidebar
-----------------

    With a sidebar on the right.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Code blocks can also have captions.
    :linenos:

    print("one")
    print("two")
    print("three")
    print("four")
    print("five")

References
==========

Footnotes
---------

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnote reference ([#label]_) and as a hyperlink reference
   (label_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.

Citations
---------

.. [12] This citation has some ``code blocks`` in it, maybe some **bold** and
       *italics* too. Heck, lets put a link to a meta citation [13]_ too.

.. [13] This citation will have one backlink.

Here's a reference to the above, [12]_ citation.

Here is another type of citation: `citation`

Targets
-------

.. _example:

This paragraph is pointed to by the explicit "example" target.
A reference can be found under `Inline Markup`_, above. `Inline
hyperlink targets`_ are also possible.

Section headers are implicit targets, referred to by name. See
Targets_.

Explicit external targets are interpolated into references such as "Python_".

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/

Targets may be indirect and anonymous.  Thus `this phrase`__ may also
refer to the Targets_ section.

__ Targets_

Target Footnotes
----------------

.. target-notes::

Centered text
=============

You can create a statement with centered text with ``.. centered::``

.. centered:: This is centered text!

Rubric
======

  A rubric is like an informal heading that doesn't correspond to the document's structure.

  -- https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#rubric

Wikipedia says it is something different:

  A rubric is a word or section of text that is traditionally written or printed in red ink for emphasis.

  -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric

This is stylized as docutils tells us to stylize it, since it is used for footnote headers (see end of https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html)

.. rubric:: This is a rubric

Sidebars and Rubrics
--------------------

.. sidebar:: Sidebar Title
   :subtitle: Optional Subtitle

   This is a sidebar.  It is for text outside the flow of the main
   text.

   .. rubric:: This is a rubric inside a sidebar

   Sidebars often appears beside the main text with a border and
   background color.
