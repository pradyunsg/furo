## Elevator pitch

<!-- start elevator-pitch -->

- **Intentionally minimal** --- the most important thing is the content, not the scaffolding around it.
- **Responsive** --- adapting perfectly to the available screen space, to work on all sorts of devices.
- **Customisable** --- change the color palette, font families, logo and more!
- **Easy to navigate** --- with carefully-designed sidebar navigation and inter-page links.
- **Good looking content** --- through clear typography and well-stylised elements.
- **Good looking search** --- helps readers find what they want quickly.
- **Biased for smaller docsets** --- intended for smaller documentation sets, where presenting the entire hierarchy in the sidebar is not overwhelming.

## Quickstart

<!-- start quickstart -->

Furo is distributed on [PyPI]. To use the theme in your Sphinx project:

1. Install Furo in documentation's build environment.

   ```text
   pip install furo
   ```

2. Update the `html_theme` in `conf.py`.

   ```py
   html_theme = "furo"
   ```

3. Your Sphinx documentation's HTML pages will now be generated with this theme! ðŸŽ‰

## What's with the name?

I plucked this from the scientific name for [Domesticated Ferrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret): Mustela putorius **furo**.

A ferret is actually a really good spirit animal for this project: cute, small, steals little things from various places, and hisses at you when you try to make it do things it doesn't like.

> I plan on commissioning a logo for this project (or making one myself) consisting of a cute ferret. Please reach out if you're interested!
