## Elevator pitch

<!-- start elevator-pitch -->

- **Intentionally minimal** --- the most important thing is the content, not the scaffolding around it.
- **Responsive** --- adapting perfectly to the available screen space, to work on all sorts of devices.
- **Customisable** --- change the color palette, font families, logo and more!
- **Easy to navigate** --- with carefully-designed sidebar navigation and inter-page links.
- **Good looking content** --- through clear typography and well-stylised elements.
- **Good looking search** --- helps readers find what they want quickly.
- **Built on Sphinx** --- a very robust static site generator, with a clear focus on documentation.
